## PiggyBank
this project is just was created to practice delegates and Eventhandlers.  It is a console program that just asks what you would like to deposit and returns your piggy banks total.  Once the total goes above $500, your goal is reached and the console will let you know.  It has methods that can be used with the delegates, but the last part of the project was to show Lambda functions, so the lambda functions are whats really doing the work.
